asyn
====
<b>asyn</b> is a general purpose facility for interfacing device specific
code to low level drivers. asynDriver allows non-blocking device support that works
with both blocking and non-blocking drivers.

A primary target for asynDriver is EPICS IOC device support but, other than using
libCom, much of it is independent of EPICS.</p>
